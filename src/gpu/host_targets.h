/**
 * @file    gpu/host_targets.h
 * @brief   Host-owned render targets (stage 4): the shadow map and the scene
 *          colour and depth are persistent host textures the guest's
 *          CreateSurface hands back every frame instead of a pooled scratch
 *          surface. Their clears are the host's (applied as the load op of
 *          the pass that draws them), their resolves are links that never
 *          copy, and the guest's Release of the handle frees nothing.
