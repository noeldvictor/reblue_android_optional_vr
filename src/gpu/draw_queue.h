// Blue Dragon submits about a thousand individually placed scene nodes a frame,
// in whatever order the guest's traversal produced, because on a Xenon the
// command processor made a draw call nearly free. Nothing in this renderer
// sorted them: ~114 pipeline switches against ~553 draws, and no depth order at
// all, so Adreno's low-resolution Z has no chance to reject a hidden fragment
// before shading it.
//
// This is the seam that fixes both. Every guest draw funnels through
// DispatchDraw, and after the constant rewrite a fully resolved draw is small:
// a pipeline, three dynamic uniform buffer offsets - the shared block carries
// the texture and sampler descriptor indices, so the material rides along - a
// vertex and index binding, and the draw parameters. That is cheap to record
// and cheap to replay.
//
// Deliberately not a render graph. It collects within one render pass and
// flushes when that pass ends, which is where the barriers already are.
