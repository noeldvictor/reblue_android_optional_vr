# re:Blue (personal fork)

re:Blue is a static recompilation of *Blue Dragon*: the original PowerPC program
is translated ahead of time into C++ and compiled as a native application. This
personal fork is moving the game's rendering out of the Xbox 360 model and into
a host-native Vulkan renderer, while gameplay remains recompiled.

## The goal: desktop host renderer, then Quest 2 VR

Move **all rendering** to the host: scene and material data, animation and GPU
skinning, shadows, reflections, particles/effects, post-processing, UI, frame
scheduling and presentation. The finished frame must no longer depend on guest
rendering execution, per-draw Xenos/D3D state translation or EDRAM emulation.

Preserve Blue Dragon's recognizable art style and readability, with freedom to
change assets, materials, lighting and geometry. Desktop asset conversion,
generated LODs, merged statics, impostors, offline texture mips and compression
are part of the work. The renderer is being built around multiview stereo,
occlusion/frustum culling, instancing, indirect draws and modern Vulkan features.

**Desktop comes first.** Fields, battles, cutscenes, menus, scene transitions,
reloads and both eyes must be verified before Quest 2 qualification and
optimization resume. The eventual Quest target is **72 Hz at 1440x1584 per eye**,
with shadows and foveation; it is not a result this fork has achieved. AYN Thor
is not an active test target.

Optional character cel shading and tourist mode remain side features. They do
not replace the host-renderer goal.

## Current state

Snapshot: 2026-09-06; the table records earlier checkpoints, with newer local work below.

This is an unfinished renderer migration, not a fully native-rendering or
Quest-ready release.

| Area | Implemented | Still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native mesh assets | Versioned persistent `.bdmesh` cache, triangle lists, shared host GPU buffers and existing generated LOD support; enabled by default | Asset-level discovery/loading, independent native layouts/materials, dynamic geometry and cache streaming/eviction |
| Material properties | Shared, content-keyed `.bdmat` assets for supported diffuse/specular/reflection recipes, independent cooker/loader and bounded residency; enabled by default | Native texture/lighting definitions, asset-level scene bindings, remaining draw recipes and replacement of the shader-register compatibility boundary |
| Receiver shadows | Host policy composition from current node visibility and model controls for supported direct-tree draws; enabled by default | Native pass/visibility producers, persistent feature policy and remaining draw recipes |
| Sun-shadow lifecycle | Complete host begin/end bodies, explicit persistent depth/output ownership and empty-pass far clears; no engine allocation or inferred resolve source; stable short flat/final-eye sequences with 38674/102251 matching ownership checks and no fallback | Engine camera snapshot/light fitting, secondary shadows, caster scheduling, sampling/resource/getter adapters, VR framing/depth and broader scene qualification |
| Native sun camera (experimental) | Native orthographic fit, snapshot and sun-volume culling; scoped removal of an obsolete character light-eye cutoff restores Shu's shadow in the normal short flat sequence (0/119 large jumps) | **Disabled by default:** latest scoped-camera VR sequence is stable with crossed depth, but does not qualify Shu's shadow in that framing. Complete character submission, other shadow modes and broader coverage remain |
| Lighting pass inputs | Host ambient/camera/colour/shadow parameter production and explicit direct-node shadow sampling; short publication/input comparisons pass | Native scene/light/texture associations, other draw recipes and removal of the material staging/shader ABI |
| Reflection bindings | Explicit model selection/enable recipes and current pass/table resolution for supported direct draws; old slot-5 image handles are not retained | Null-selection inheritance, animated/ordinary texture overrides, deferred/other-phase recipes and persistent native scene associations |
| Scene-image selection | Host selectors/binding callback and explicit per-draw current/next roles; replay resolves live inputs instead of retaining old images, with matching source checks | Scene-table production, persistent associations, intra-node pass sequences, wrapper blend/constants and dynamic/null GPU coverage |
| Nested render passes | Host attachment/extent stack, complete supported push/pop bodies, typed native entry/exit and shared attachment binders | Engine traversal, other pass producers, getter/lifetime adapters, multiple colour attachments, deeper GPU nesting and full visual qualification |
| Scene lifecycle | Host begin/end bodies with explicit persistent colour/depth roles and explicit-source outputs; no engine 16-slot allocation or resolve-source guessing; short flat and corrected final-eye sequences are stable, with two-layer depth outputs | State 308, engine camera sources/descriptors/getters, shared MSAA/scale copies, downstream post/UI tile-chain adapters and broader visual qualification |
| Camera/frustum cache | Complete host inverse/unprojection/orientation and native cached shapes, using native transform values; 15341 matching full publications and stable short normal flat/final-eye sequences without fallback/imports | Engine camera sources, inherited transform imports, invalidation/settings/getters, cache-hit GPU coverage, VR framing/depth and broader scene qualification |
| Texture assets | Persistent `.bdtex` assets, independent mip cooking, shared host GPU ownership, direct immutable material bindings and native stable samplers; enabled by default | Asset-level scene associations, dynamic/inherited inputs, remaining imports and headset-specific formats |
| Resource uploads | Bounded host staging pages, fence-safe reuse/retirement, separate from shader constants | Complete native dynamic-geometry producers and asset streaming/backpressure |
| Deferred work | Host depth, ordering, bounded batch planning, consumer loop, surface expansion and cleanup | Native scene/pass inputs, remaining entry fields, engine storage and visual/material/state adapters |
| Object/pass transforms | Host world/view/projection publication and view-projection composition, direct native camera/XR view input; enabled by default | Engine object/camera sources, inherited matrix cache, complete native scene/pass data and shader-ABI removal |
| Parameter producers | Host pass-projection builders, matrix transposition, parameter flush and both float setters; 1891328 matching original-publication checks and stable short normal flat/final-eye sequences | Engine parameter blocks, inline writers, draw-time shader-register import, native pass/material associations and broader visual qualification |
| View frustum | Native six-plane construction and current-frame host-culling ownership; byte-safe imports, 18341 matching producer checks, 436841 matching consumer-shadow checks and stable short normal flat/final-eye sequences | Engine camera sources, other-view clients, getter publications and broader visual qualification |
| Skin bindings | Explicit per-draw model-local joint indices and host-owned current palette gathering; matrix-value identity guessing removed | Native animation/pose producers, persistent skeleton/skin assets, remaining discovery/entry adapters and a dedicated GPU palette ABI |
| Raster state | Native depth, cull/fill, colour-write and stencil intent; host setter execution and no normal per-draw raster-cache translation | Sampler and other-state producers, engine getter shadows, complete material/pass recipes and unexercised stencil GPU paths |
| Sampler producers | Complete scene defaults and seven supported setters execute on the host; 146571 matching original-publication checks and stable short normal flat/final-eye sequences | Inline material writers, other setters, per-draw fetch import, independent native live intent and broader GPU coverage |
| Blend state | Native RGB/alpha blend intent and eight host setters; no normal per-draw Xenos blend-register import | Native material/pass producers, removal of getter shadows, blend constants and separate-alpha/operation GPU coverage |
| Alpha policy | Native cutout/reference/compare/coverage intent, four host setters, shared CPU/shader comparison contract and live ordinary-draw composition | Native material/pass producers, removal of getter/replay adapters, non-GE GPU coverage and multisample/custom coverage qualification |
| Scene submission | Host traversal/replay, authoritative native packet pipelines, frustum/occlusion culling, instancing, vertex pulling and indirect submissions | Replace retained guest draw templates and material/constant producers; remove remaining guest resource dependencies |
| Frame and VR | Host whole-view/pass lifecycle scheduling, targets/post-processing, layered multiview presentation and desktop OpenXR test runtime | Complete native frame ownership, scene/descriptor/participant inputs, effects/UI/animation ownership and representative full-game visual checks |
| Effect registry and lifecycle | Host selector policy, signed/stable ordering, array mutation, both preparation groups, paired cleanup and array teardown; enabled by default | Native flag/metadata/callback producers, registry storage/identities and full lifecycle GPU qualification |
| DoF production | Complete preparation/submission replacements, native parameters and explicit-input atlas; no supported-path DoF level allocations, quads, intermediate target/resolve or PS c27 reads; enabled by default | Authored camera/focus sources, image/getter adapters, compatibility scopes and broader view/focus qualification |
| DoF/bloom/flare scheduling | Native atlas/composite and 15 optical sprites in one instanced draw into an explicit persistent output; host-prepared input descriptors remove the three startup/transition guest warm-up scopes; normal flat/VR record zero post fallbacks | Native light/visibility producers, per-eye optics, image/property/UI adapters and broader scene coverage |
| Effect-sequence scheduling | Host-owned ordered post-root dispatch consumes a per-view, single-use completed-scene result with explicit colour/depth/exposure; native pins preserve source lifetime, normal post skips getter/resolve-link imports; direct inter-root images, at most two alternating outputs and one final publication | Remaining scaling/output adapters, final UI publication, engine list/property/request producers, compatibility imports, unknown callbacks and multi-root/HDR/nested-view GPU qualification |
| Directional bloom | Independent horizontal/vertical 13-tap masks in at most two private quarter-pair atlases; layered native passes replace the mode-1 guest mask cache, blur submission and resolves | Authored mode-1 activation/kernel comparisons and combined heat/bloom coverage; strong previews are stable but washed-out VR makes preview depth inconclusive; other bloom modes retain native approximations |
| Optical adjustments | Fisheye and colour inversion fused into one native layered pass; output-aspect-aware curve, explicit attachment records and private input scratch without a seed copy or emulated resolve; visible flat/both-eye previews verified | Authored activation/parameter comparisons and event coverage, VR comfort |
| Scanline filter | Native four-tap layered pass after optical adjustments, with host-frame animation independent of gameplay RNG; existing noise-off default retained; 860 authored strength comparisons match | Broad event coverage; earlier noisy VR preview has 1/31 large changes in visible wave bands, not a normal stability qualification |
| Colour grading and grain | Native discolor/correction/grain pass, explicit 80-byte parameters and shared-eye animation using existing cooked assets; packed producer/texture-list/resolve removed; three post stages reuse at most two scratch images | Authored grain-event coverage and property/image adapters; deliberate RNG sequence change, no VR comfort qualification |
| Heat shimmer | Native depth-aware scene displacement fused into the composite, with unwarped bloom, four noise taps, shared-eye animation and explicit 224-byte composite layout; no extra full-image target or guest phase writes | Authored activation/parameter checks, events and VR comfort; strong synthetic previews have 31/31 large changes, not normal stability passes |
| Native eye geometry | Shared full runtime extent for scene and final layers; separate authored UI scale; 1440x1584 scene/final-eye pixels verified without letterboxing at XR scale 1.0 | Blur, UI/cinema/movie GPU qualification and broader modes; the default XR scale remains 0.65 |
| Tracked camera ownership | Explicit per-view native composition, reused by scene and shadow preparation; generic light/2D/post matrix writes no longer drive tracking | Native camera sources, interpolation, reflection derivation, focus production and complete frame scheduling; renderer descriptor adapters remain |
| Desktop verification | All 30 material/texture/state/camera/post CTests and 45 source guards pass; scene-result normal flat/VR have zero post getter imports/fallbacks, 0/119 large changes, no cyan hits and correctly crossed first/last VR depth; both eyes inspected | Authored effect events, multi-root/HDR/nested-view GPU cases, title artwork, distant VR blur, per-eye flare optics and VR character-shadow/full-game coverage remain unqualified; earlier late-scene failures are not superseded |
| Android / Quest 2 | ARM64 build/APK and OpenXR/controller foundations exist from earlier work | Full desktop completion gate, then fresh device qualification and optimization |

Newer [local native-resolve integration](research/20260905_2206_native-scene-resolve-ownership.md)
gives scene MSAA native colour/depth resolve images and removes the initial colour
copy from normal native post. Host builds, 30 CPU tests, 46 source guards and
normal/post-disabled recovery diagnostics pass; one bounded desktop window image
was inspected. [Native multiview state ordering](research/20260905_2305_native-multiview-state.md)
is now fixed in local Plume `81bdca8`, with validated tiny GPU readbacks and
capture-disabled desktop XR/non-MSAA diagnostics. Depth/getter publications and
full-frame pixel/game qualification remain unfinished. The scene integration is **not yet committed
or published**: dependency publication needs owner approval before its parent
gitlink can be committed. The table above describes earlier checkpoints.

The [native post-resource boundary](research/20260905_2351_native-post-resource-contract.md)
removes output and optical-image headers from post rendering, retaining native
HDR images between roots. Its independent contract/test is checkpointed locally;
renderer wiring remains pending with the scene integration. The host build,
31 CPU tests, 48 source guards and capture-disabled flat/XR optical diagnostics
pass. At that checkpoint temporary output allocation and final UI/depth
publication still needed conversion; these were not new pixel qualifications.

The [native post-image ownership](research/20260906_0014_native-post-image-ownership.md)
replaces the post output allocator with a bounded native FP16 pool. The final
getter borrows the completed image/descriptor without a copy or resolve link;
live readers prevent write-lease reuse and destruction is fence-gated. The host
build, 31 CPU tests and 50 source guards pass. Normal flat, optical XR and
non-MSAA diagnostics have zero post imports/fallbacks/refusals and settle at two
resident post images. One normal-flat window PNG was inspected, not a new
flat/VR sequence qualification. The independent pool/test is locally checkpointed;
GPU integration remains uncommitted pending dependency publication approval.
At that checkpoint initial depth publication, UI scheduling and full-frame/game
gates remained open.

The [native depth-image handoff](research/20260906_0110_native-depth-image-lease.md)
removes matching MSAA depth copies/resolve links and shares one live layout record
between native owners and adapters. The
[single-sample ownership change](research/20260906_0138_native-single-sample-ownership.md)
also moves non-MSAA scene images/views/descriptors into a bounded, fence-retired
native store without duplicating GPU images. Native post receives those source
images directly; depth getters borrow their backing. Host build, 31 CPU tests,
53 source guards and bounded non-MSAA flat/XR/recovery plus default-MSAA checks
pass. Normal non-MSAA flat/XR record 3,600/10,200 native depth handoffs and zero
compatibility depth publications or native-post imports/refusals. One non-MSAA
flat PNG was inspected, not new sequence/stereo qualification. Independent
contracts/tests are local checkpoints; renderer
integration still awaits dependency publication approval. Protected raw/failure
evidence remains; superseded small diagnostics are cleaned up at checkpoints.

The [native scene source allocation](research/20260906_0200_native-scene-source-allocation.md)
creates both MSAA and single-sample scene attachments from explicit native recipes;
it no longer allocates them through SurfacePool or Xbox-format inputs. Binding
headers remain temporary adapters, and native resolve framebuffers retain their
source images. Host build, 31 CPU tests, 55 source guards and five bounded flat/XR/
recovery checks pass, with zero unexpected native-post fallbacks or compatibility
depth publications. Two flat sanity PNGs were inspected and replaced older
equivalents; they do not qualify sequences or stereo pixels.

The [native scene framebuffer ownership](research/20260906_0236_native-scene-framebuffers.md)
also removes single-sample scene framebuffer creation from the resource-header
cache. Exact native attachment owners, mono/stereo recipes and fence retirement
replace that lifetime dependency. Host build, 31 CPU tests, 57 source guards and
four bounded flat/XR/recovery checks pass; one non-MSAA flat PNG was inspected,
not new sequence/stereo qualification. Superseded diagnostics were removed,
reclaiming 8,167,424 B measured without touching protected raw/failure evidence.
At that checkpoint native pass commands/clears, remaining getters/scaling, full
scene/UI/frame ownership and desktop game gates remained open. Independent
contracts/tests are local commits;
renderer integration is still unpublished pending dependency approval.

The [native scene command ownership](research/20260906_0255_native-scene-commands.md)
moves attachment write layouts, first-use discards, framebuffer binds and typed
clears into the native scene scope, bypassing alias/seed/tile-chain selection.
Empty scenes clear before publication; resumed scopes do not clear twice.
The [precision-boundary change](research/20260906_0333_native-scene-state-bridge.md)
also removes both guest high-precision-blend calls (state 308): native attachments
stay FP16 without toggling console surface/packet formats. Only final getter words
remain published for unconverted clients. Host build, 31 CPU tests, 60 source
guards and bounded normal flat/XR/non-MSAA checks pass, with zero scene state-308
calls, compatibility clears/depth publications or post imports/refusals. One new
flat sanity PNG was inspected and replaced its predecessor, not sequence/stereo/
full-game qualification. This follow-up reclaimed 7,196,672 B of superseded
diagnostics. Complete draw-state execution, remaining getters/scaling, scene/UI/
frame ownership and desktop game gates remain; integration publication still
needs approval.

The [whole-view scheduler](research/20260906_0442_native-view-schedule.md) now
executes parent branch selection, pass order and reflection/focus geometry on the
host, including starts previously inlined around the shared
[pass lifecycle dispatcher](research/20260906_0412_native-pass-dispatch.md).
Host build, 31 CPU tests and 65 source guards pass. Bounded flat/XR checks record
3,601/9,601 native views with zero parent or dispatcher fallbacks/refusals/faults;
post-disabled coverage keeps the parent native while exercising isolated legacy
post cleanup. Non-MSAA coverage also passed. One flat sanity PNG was inspected;
superseded small diagnostics were removed, reclaiming 8.04 MB measured. Imported
authored scene data, descriptors, registry and remaining callbacks are still conversion work, and the
full desktop game/stereo gate is open. No new raw captures or Quest runs were made.

The [effect activation and registration change](research/20260906_0516_native-effect-activation.md)
moves all selector cases and three-group registration/removal algorithms to host
code. Host build, 31 CPU tests, 69 source guards and bounded flat/XR checks pass;
both runs exercise native registration/removal without fallback or faults.
The [preparation/cleanup follow-up](research/20260906_0536_native-effect-lifecycle.md)
also moves both preparation groups, paired resource/participant cleanup and array
teardown onto the host. Host build, 31 CPU tests, 72 source guards and bounded
flat/XR field checks pass with zero lifecycle fallback/refusal/faults. A flat
sanity PNG was inspected; global teardown has CPU coverage only, and full-game/
both-eye qualification remains open. Shared storage, identities and callback
implementations remain imports. Superseded diagnostics were removed, reclaiming
6.28 MB measured, with 60.10 GiB free; no new raw captures or Quest runs were made.

The [native snapshot follow-up](research/20260906_0629_native-scene-snapshots.md)
adds host-owned HDR image copies and a tiny off-screen GPU fixture. It found and
fixed a Vulkan pending-clear/resolve ordering bug; eight mono/stereo and
1/2/4/8-sample cases pass with zero validation errors/warnings, alongside the
host build and 31 CPU tests. Native-extent publication is in the pending
integration; actual authored snapshot-copy use remains unproven. No new raw
captures were made, and superseded diagnostics were removed. This is not full
host-frame or full-game/stereo qualification; remote publication needs approval.

The [water/refraction setup follow-up](research/20260906_0700_native-refraction-materials.md)
moves two whole material callbacks onto the host, preserving blending/depth-write
policy and the water-highlight clamp. Host build, 31 CPU tests and 83 source guards
pass. A bounded flat run exercises 1,964 water preparations without material
fallback/refusal/faults; one sanity image was inspected. Refraction/snapshot
execution remains unobserved in that field. Native material updates/assets,
parameter/state/getter adapters and full-frame qualification remain open. Ten
superseded diagnostics were removed, reclaiming 4.27 MB measured; no raw captures.

The last pixel-verified [native scene-result evidence](research/20260905_1958_native-scene-image-result.md)
records scoped image ownership, exact binary/settings and flat/both-eye checks.
Six superseded normal raw sets and their automatic copies/links were removed,
retaining their 16 previews and reports; two new sets form the baseline. Net
volume usage fell 7.38 GiB, with 60.97 GiB free. The historical archive still
exceeds its budget; the no-growth and reclaim-before-capture rules remain in force.

The mesh/capture evidence and its limits are recorded in
[the native mesh research note](research/20260904_1713_native-mesh-assets-and-capture-ownership.md);
[the native material note](research/20260904_1748_native-material-properties.md)
records material-source checks and flat/multiview correctness comparisons.
The following notes describe earlier checkpoints; the latest packet-ownership
result below supersedes their short-field flicker findings, not their remaining
ownership or full-game coverage limitations.
The persistent material contract and standalone cooker are documented in
[Native material assets](docs/NATIVE_MATERIAL_FORMAT.md).
The [native texture contract](docs/NATIVE_TEXTURE_FORMAT.md) covers texture
files, the independent mip cooker, native sampling and the remaining resource bridge.
The [binding checkpoint](research/20260904_1946_native-material-texture-bindings.md)
passed its short flat capture. [Host upload pages](docs/HOST_UPLOAD_ARENA.md)
remove the subsequent texture/constant-buffer wrapping hazard, but the later
scene still has unqualified dark/missing-geometry frames; see
[the upload evidence](research/20260904_1959_host-upload-pages.md).
The [receiver-shadow checkpoint](research/20260904_2041_native-shadow-receiver-inputs.md)
passes its short flat sequence and input checks, but reproduces the 64-frame
multiview defect. Its longer baseline also confirms the later scene remains
broken after the upload lifetime fixes.
The [host deferred-work checkpoint](research/20260904_2055_host-deferred-work.md)
removes guest allocation/sorting execution from its normal path, with passing
standalone and short flat checks; the multiview defect remains reproducible.
The [live depth checkpoint](research/20260904_2122_live-native-deferred-depth.md)
also replaces initial depth execution and stale replay keys with host calculation
from current transforms. Its input comparison and normal flat capture pass;
the multiview defect and incomplete stereo-depth qualification remain.
The [host consumer checkpoint](research/20260904_2154_host-deferred-consumer.md)
also replaces the guest deferred-list loop, with explicit counters for the
remaining engine adapters. This is not full native frame ownership, and it
does not resolve the known multiview or later-scene failures.
The [native transform producer](research/20260904_2216_native-render-transforms.md)
removes another guest producer and its matrix/constant helper calls; the final
input/publication comparison has no mismatches or compatibility calls.
The [native raster checkpoint](research/20260904_2238_native-raster-intent.md)
also moves 15 raster setters and ordinary draw-time raster intent to the host;
other-state execution and engine getter shadows remain explicitly tracked.
The [native blend checkpoint](research/20260904_2302_native-blend-intent.md)
replaces eight blend setters and removes the normal draw-time blend-register
import; blend constants and independent material/pass sources
remain work in progress.
The [native alpha checkpoint](research/20260904_2327_native-alpha-policy.md)
moves four more setters and ordinary-draw cutout/coverage intent to the host,
with tested shared shader comparisons and the corrected reference scale.
Engine getter shadows, retained replay recipes and broader GPU coverage remain.
Its final desktop multiview sequence still shows flicker/banding and an
inconclusive stereo-depth result; the alpha conversion does not qualify VR.
Passing this desktop slice does not establish full-game coverage or headset
performance.

The [native draw-packet fix](research/20260904_2348_native-draw-intent.md) stops
engine shader/declaration and render-state history from overwriting host packet
intent during dispatch. Replay stays enabled. The latest short flat and final-eye
multiview sequences have no large jumps or cyan patches, and inspected eyes no
longer show broad horizontal banding. Blur/letterboxing, inconclusive depth,
below-target eye sizing and full-scene coverage still require work. The
[longer rerun](research/20260905_0010_native-draw-late-scene.md) at that checkpoint
had deformed geometry, disappearing scenery and damaged text.
This fixes packet consumption, not the retained recipe or scene/pass producers.

The [per-draw native skin checkpoint](research/20260905_0025_native-skin-bindings.md)
removes joint identity guessing and the node-wide retained bone table. Its
palette-source checks have zero mismatches; inspected late-scene characters no
longer stretch across the frame with replay enabled. Background surfaces and
text still fail, and the stable short multiview sequence remains inconclusive
for stereo depth. Animation evaluation and pose sources are still engine-owned.

The [recurring replay diagnostics](research/20260905_0053_recurring-draw-verification.md)
preserve later-scene examples, distinguish declared shader inputs, compare buffer
fields without padding noise and flag incomplete draw comparisons. They expose
remaining camera/material input differences; they do not fix or qualify the
later scenery/text failure.

The [host lighting producer](research/20260905_0121_native-lighting-pass.md)
replaces lighting setup execution and supplies direct-node shadow sampling
parameters from explicit host records. The short comparison has no publication
or direct-node input mismatches. Normal late and multiview runs have no lighting
fallbacks or direct-node source mismatches, but later scenery/text still fail
and stereo depth remains inconclusive. Engine scene/texture associations,
material staging and other retained inputs remain; this is not complete frame
ownership.

The [reflection-selection checkpoint](research/20260905_0144_native-reflection-selection.md)
separates material selection from image lifetime and reflection enable. Supported
direct draws resolve current bindings before submission; null selections remain
an explicit compatibility boundary because the existing texture adapter treats
them as no-ops. This is not full reflection-pass or frame ownership.
Its first normal late run exposed a registry/upload deadlock despite matching
source counters. The [lock-order correction](research/20260905_0235_reflection-validation-lock-order.md)
moves binding validation outside the draw lock. The corrected run advances
through loading with 1214021 matching source checks, but inspected later frames
still lose rock-wall surfaces and damage text. Normal multiview remains stable
over its short sequence but blurred/letterboxed and inconclusive for depth.

The [scene-image producer](research/20260905_0301_native-scene-textures.md)
replaces current/next scene selection and its binding callback on the host.
The desktop comparison has no selection or publication mismatches, but only
14 callback publications were exercised; all bound images used native handles.
Its early field/title-transition capture alone does not requalify later scenes
or VR. The [scene-input replay checkpoint](research/20260905_0318_native-scene-input-recipes.md)
now replaces retained bindings with explicit roles and distinguishes different
selection paths even when their images match. Normal execution has 34 matching
source checks and 13133 scene-role draws, but still reproduces rock-wall popping.
The full-size desktop VR check uses `bd_xr_render_scale=1.0`: final layers reach
1440x1584 per eye with a stable short sequence, but content is letterboxed to
1440x808, blurred and inconclusive for depth. That VR view does not exercise
the scene-image callbacks. Native scene associations, pass sequences and other
material inputs remain; no Quest performance or full-frame completion is claimed.

## Project documentation

The [sampler producer checkpoint](research/20260905_0436_host-sampler-producers.md)
replaces complete scene defaults and seven supported setters. Publication
comparison and short normal desktop/final-eye checks pass, but inline material
writers and draw-time fetch import remain. It does not qualify later scenery,
text, stereo depth or full native frames.

The [frustum checkpoint](research/20260905_0559_native-frustum-producer.md)
moves complete plane construction and default-view culling volume ownership
to the host. The [native camera/cache checkpoint](research/20260905_0717_native-view-cache.md)
also replaces view inverse/unprojection/orientation execution and uses native
transform values and cached shapes. Original comparisons and short normal
flat/final-eye sequences pass. Engine camera sources, invalidation/settings,
getter clients and broader scene/frame producers remain. Stable final eyes
still do not qualify their framing or stereo depth.

The [sun-shadow lifecycle checkpoint](research/20260905_0756_native-shadow-pass-lifecycle.md)
replaces complete attachment setup/output/teardown and removes resolve-source
guessing for that pass. Scene-camera snapshot and light fitting still execute
through counted engine adapters; secondary shadows and caster scheduling remain.

## Desktop verification

The main desktop loop uses the Vulkan executable and
[the repository's headless OpenXR runtime](.claude/skills/vrsim/SKILL.md).
It exercises the VR path without a headset; it cannot prove Quest performance,
device-only foveation or comfort.

Desktop settings go in `profiles/default/reblue.toml` under the install root.
Use `bd_xr_autoplay` for field-scene bring-up and `bd_capture_after_s`,
`bd_capture_min_draws` and `bd_capture_frames` for capture sequences. Verify the
live settings in the log and inspect the actual images.

- `tools/capture_seq.py` flags neighbouring-frame changes.
- `tools/capture_cyan.py` checks a known visual artifact.
- `tools/stereo_check.py --raw <capture> --stacked` examines layered stereo.
  Featureless black bars/sky are inconclusive, not proof of depth.

Multiview is the target stereo path. Do not enable legacy side-by-side
`bd_stereo` alongside `bd_stereo_multiview`. Capture the final presented eyes
when qualifying presentation; `bd_mv_capture_array` selects a scene target
instead.

## Hardware Requirements

Requires all three retail Blue Dragon discs or their disc images. The desktop requirements below are inherited upstream baselines, not a fresh qualification of this experimental renderer. Android and Quest remain unsupported development targets.

### Minimum

- OS: Windows 10 version 1909 or later, Ubuntu 24.04 / Fedora 40 / SteamOS 3.6 or later, or macOS 13.3 Ventura or later
- Processor: Intel Core i5-4460 3.2 GHz 4 Core or AMD Ryzen 3 1200 or Apple M1, or equivalent
- Memory: 8 GB RAM
- GPU: Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti or AMD RX 570, or equivalent performance & VRAM. DirectX 12 with Shader Model 6.0, or Vulkan 1.2, or Metal
- Storage: 15 GB available space

### Recommended

- OS: Windows 11, SteamOS 3.6, or macOS 14 Sonoma or later
- Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or Intel Core i5-12400 or Apple M2, or equivalent performance, 6 physical cores minimum
- Memory: 16 GB RAM
- GPU: Nvidia RTX 2060 or AMD RX 5700, or equivalent performance & VRAM. 8 GB VRAM for 4K with MSAA
- Storage: 15 GB available space

## How to Install

This fork publishes no releases. [Download the latest upstream release for your platform](https://github.com/zolaware/reblue/releases/latest) or [build yourself](#building).

1. Blue Dragon shipped on three DVDs, and you will need a disc image of each one from your own copy of the game.

2. Run the executable. A setup wizard will guide you through the rest. You will be asked to point it at each of the three disc images in turn, and it will check each one before letting you continue. Once you pick where to install, the program copies itself there and restarts from that location, so you can delete the folder you extracted the zip into.

3. Pick a graphics quality preset. The wizard copies the game files out of the discs, and you are done. You may also install DLC from this installer or from the main menu under the config menu

The wizard only needs to run once. If something later goes missing from your install, launching with `--repair` reopens it on your existing install and copies back only what it needs.

## Features

These features are inherited from upstream re:Blue. The host-renderer transition is still in progress; this list is not a claim that every feature has been reverified in this fork.

- Anisotropic filtering
- Shadow quality and draw distance
- Depth of field adjustment
- Unlocked FPS with optional caps and VSync

### Quality of Life

- Unlocked frame rate, with optional caps at 30, 60, 90, or 120

## FAQ

### Where is my save data and configuration stored?

Everything lives under the folder you installed to:

- Saves and settings: `profiles\default\`
- Your configuration file: `profiles\default\reblue.toml`
- Game files copied from your discs: `game\`
- Mods: `mods\`

### I want to update the game. Will I lose my save data?

No. Copy a newer build over your existing installation and your saves, settings, and mods are left alone. You do not need to reinstall or point the wizard at your discs again.

### How do I install mods?

Use the mod manager in the config menu. It accepts a mod folder or a zip file and puts everything in the right place for you

### Can I keep more than one set of saves?

Yes. Each profile is its own folder under `profiles\`, holding that profile's saves, settings, achievements, and DLC toggles. Launch with `--profile <name>` to pick one, and anything but `default` starts out fresh.

## Building

The build needs CMake, Ninja, a C++23 Clang toolchain, the
[ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk), the checked-out submodules
and `assets/default.xex` from your own game disc. Windows also needs vcpkg
(including DXC). Game executables, generated guest code and cooked game assets
are not distributed in this repository.

Read the [dev-loop guide](.claude/skills/devloop/SKILL.md) for SDK/bootstrap
details and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for current rules. Some older setup passages
in the guide are historical; in particular, a Vulkan-only build's target is
`reblue`, not `reblue_vk`.

For the **already configured workspace** used by this fork:

```powershell
$env:PATH = 'C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin;' + $env:PATH
$env:VCPKG_ROOT = 'C:\vcpkg'
cmake --build --preset win-amd64-release --target reblue -j 4
```

That tree is configured with `REBLUE_D3D12=OFF`, `REBLUE_OPENXR=ON` and PCH on;
its output is `out/build/win-amd64-release/reblue_vk.exe`. These are local
configuration choices, not the untouched preset defaults. Reuse an existing
tree rather than rebuilding the guest to test host changes.

For a fresh desktop configure, bootstrap the SDK/codegen and dependencies first,
then select a Vulkan-only preset and configure OpenXR headers/loader as described
in the [vrsim guide](.claude/skills/vrsim/SKILL.md):

```sh
cmake --preset win-vk-release -DREBLUE_OPENXR=ON
cmake --build --preset win-vk-release --target reblue
```

[CMakePresets.json](CMakePresets.json) also includes Linux/macOS and
`android-arm64` presets. Android requires a cross-built SDK plus host-native
codegen/shader tools; `tools/build_apk.sh` packages the APK. Their existence is
not a claim that this revision has been qualified on each platform. Quest runs
remain deferred until the complete desktop host-renderer gate passes.

Standalone checks for the current mesh, material, texture/lifetime and stereo work:

```sh
cmake -S tools/native_mesh_test -B out/native_mesh_check -G Ninja
cmake --build out/native_mesh_check
ctest --test-dir out/native_mesh_check --output-on-failure
cmake -S tools/native_material_test -B out/native_material_test -G Ninja
cmake --build out/native_material_test
ctest --test-dir out/native_material_test --output-on-failure
cmake -S tools/native_texture_test -B out/native_texture_test -G Ninja
cmake --build out/native_texture_test
ctest --test-dir out/native_texture_test --output-on-failure
python tools/stereo_check_test.py
python tools/reflection_lock_order_test.py
```

Use the configured Clang toolchain (on Windows, supply `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` and
`CMAKE_RC_COMPILER` if needed). The Python stereo tests require Pillow.

## Credits

Huge thanks to everyone who has put time into this. re:Blue would not be where it is without you.

**None of these people work on this fork, and none of them should be contacted about it.** The
credits below are upstream's, kept because they earned them and because the license says to keep
them. Everything re:Blue actually is came from [zolaware/reblue](https://github.com/zolaware/reblue);
everything broken in this repo came from me and a language model.

### re:Blue Development Team

- **[crack](https://github.com/tomcl7)** project lead and developer

- **[rcold](https://github.com/RC0ld)** developer and has done an absurd amount for this project. A lot of re:Blue looks the way it does because of him.
