# Host renderer transition

The owner's active goal is to move **all rendering** to the host, remove the
Xbox 360 rendering model, and use modern GPU and VR techniques on desktop.
Gameplay remains recompiled. Preserve Blue Dragon's art style and readability;
materials, lighting, geometry, effects and asset formats may change for performance.
Quest 2 optimization follows the completed desktop transition.

## Completion requirements

All of these remain required; shipping an intermediate component is not completion.

- Host frame scheduling and pass construction, with no guest rendering execution
  or per-draw D3D/Xenos state translation in the finished frame.
- Host scene and object data, materials, animation and GPU skinning, shadows,
  reflections, particles/effects, post-processing, UI and presentation.
- Native asset conversion with explicit versioned formats, stable identities,
  desktop cooking and persistent output. Meshes, textures/mips/compression and
  materials must not depend on transient guest allocation addresses.
- Multiview stereo and correctly sized layered targets; host frustum and
  occlusion culling, instancing, indirect draws and suitable generated LODs,
  merged geometry and impostors.
- Remove EDRAM allocation, tile matching, seed copies and emulated resolves
  from the frame. Ordinary GPU resolves needed for native MSAA are distinct.
- Verify representative fields, battles, cutscenes, menus, scene transitions
  and reloads on desktop, including both eyes and animated effects. Record
  remaining guest rendering calls and resource dependencies explicitly.
- Only after that desktop gate: Quest 2 qualification and VR optimization,
  including foveation, toward the recorded 72 Hz / 1440x1584-per-eye target.

## Current conversion

Native depth-image lease (2026-09-06, local renderer integration): matching
MSAA depth getters now borrow the native resolved image/view/descriptor instead
of copying it or creating a resolve link. Native and remaining adapter accesses
share one live layout record; final post outputs use the same retained-image
boundary. Host build, 31 CPU tests and 52 source guards pass. Normal flat/XR
record 3,600/9,600 native depth handoffs and zero compatibility depth publications;
normal native post has zero imports/original scopes/refusals. Post-disabled
recovery publishes all 3,600 pending colours while still borrowing native depth.
Non-MSAA post also passes but its 3,600 depth handoffs remain compatibility work;
scaled/other-format cases and complete scene/UI/frame ownership remain open.
One normal-flat PNG was inspected, not sequence/stereo/full-game qualification.
Twenty superseded diagnostics, including two replaced normal-flat PNGs, were
removed (11,141,120 B measured reclaimed), preserving raw/failure evidence.
Independent lease/layout contracts and tests are the local checkpoint; renderer
integration and Plume gitlink publication still await approval. No Quest work.
Evidence: `research/20260906_0110_native-depth-image-lease.md`.

Native post-image ownership (2026-09-06, local renderer integration): post
outputs now have their own bounded FP16 image/view/framebuffer pool, not
`PostColor` resource-header allocations. Native write leases exclude live
readers; the final UI/getter borrows the completed image and descriptor without
a copy or resolve link. Old backing/framebuffers retire behind a fence. The
host build, 31 CPU tests and 50 source guards pass. Normal flat, optical XR and
non-MSAA flat diagnostics record 3,601/7,501/3,601 native scopes and zero imports,
original scopes or refusals; residency settles at two post images. One existing
normal-flat PNG was inspected without obvious full-frame corruption, not a new
sequence/stereo qualification. The independent pool/test is the local checkpoint;
GPU creation/publication wiring and the required Plume gitlink remain uncommitted
pending dependency publication approval. Initial depth publication, UI scheduling,
remaining guest frame/game gates and Quest qualification remain open. Evidence:
`research/20260906_0014_native-post-image-ownership.md`.

Native post output/optical contract (2026-09-06): the rendering core now accepts
native HDR attachments and sampled optical images; it no longer reads output,
flare, heat or grain resource headers. Native inter-root reads carry the completed
image directly. The independent output contract/test is locally checkpointed;
renderer wiring remains uncommitted alongside the unpublished scene integration.
The host build, 31 CPU tests and 48 source guards pass. Capture-disabled XR with
synthetic flare/heat/animated grain and normal non-MSAA flat runs record
8,401/3,601 native post scopes with zero imports/original scopes/refusals.
Both profiles were restored. This removes core header dependencies, not the
temporary output allocator, final UI/depth publications or remaining frame/game
gates; no new pixel qualification or Quest work. Thirteen superseded small
diagnostics were removed (888,832 B measured reclaimed). Evidence:
`research/20260905_2351_native-post-resource-contract.md`.

Native Vulkan multiview state ordering (2026-09-05, local Plume `81bdca8`):
lazy native pass begin now reestablishes current native bindings, including
descriptor offsets and incremental push values, with layout-disturbance and
static/dynamic-state lifetime handling. The previously hidden first stereo draw
failure was reproduced before GPU submission. The expanded 8x8 GPU readback suite
passes mono/two-eye, indirect, pass-restart and compute/graphics transitions with
zero API errors/warnings. Desktop host build, 30 CPU tests and 46 source guards
pass. Capture-disabled XR/non-MSAA flat diagnostics record 8,701/3,601 native post
scopes, zero imports/original scopes/refusals, with profiles restored. No new
game pixels, full-game qualification or Quest work; publishing remains blocked
pending approval. Evidence: `research/20260905_2305_native-multiview-state.md`.

Native scene resolve integration (2026-09-05, **local uncommitted renderer work**):
scene MSAA now writes separately owned native colour/depth resolve images with
generation-safe keys, bounded residency and fence-gated descriptor/image lifetime.
Normal native post skips the initial colour copy; empty/refused/disabled post and
unconsumed normal views explicitly recover the required getter publication.
Initial depth and final UI/getter publications remain. The desktop host build,
30 CPU tests and 46 source guards pass. Normal/recovery diagnostics verify
3,600 deferred colours with zero/all recovered respectively; one bounded window
PNG was inspected, not a new sequence/VR qualification. The multiview ordering
fix above is GPU-tested; full image/game gates and remaining ownership conversion
are still open.
Publishing the required Plume dependency still needs owner approval; neither the
integration code nor its parent gitlink is committed. No raw captures or Quest
work. Evidence: `research/20260905_2206_native-scene-resolve-ownership.md`.

Native sampled-image inputs (2026-09-05): scene completion, native atlas,
composite and directional-bloom scene/depth reads now carry native texture and
descriptor identities with the owner's live layout record, without GuestTexture
headers in the input contract. Boundary adapters prepare sampling views; native
preflight rejects unresolved MSAA, invalid dimensions/descriptors/exposure,
eye-count mismatches and physical-image feedback before GPU work. The desktop
host build, 30 native texture/post CTests and 43 post/scene source guards pass.
Two capture-disabled flat diagnostics (default MSAA and no MSAA) each record
3,601 native post scopes, zero scene-image imports/original scopes/refusals;
the latter exercises direct source images. No new pixel or VR qualification.
At that checkpoint, initial scene publication copies, output/optical-image
adapters, native resolve producer wiring and full-frame/game gates remained.
No captures, downloads or Quest work. Evidence:
`research/20260905_2129_native-scene-attachment-images.md`.

Native attachment-resolve prerequisite (2026-09-05, before scene integration):
local Plume commit `a8b3c15` adds layered colour/depth MSAA resolve attachments,
mode/capability preflight and clear/discard handling. Test commit `465c2ad` also
covers actual FP16 HDR/D32_FLOAT_S8_UINT scene formats, depth MIN/SAMPLE_ZERO
with stencil NONE, resumed LOAD and held clears. Its 8x8 real-GPU test
passes mono/two-eye sample averaging, depth MIN versus SAMPLE_ZERO, LOAD,
DISCARD, pending/held zero-draw clears and eighteen-attachment readbacks with
core/synchronization validation (zero API errors/warnings). The existing 30 CPU
tests also passed without rebuilding them. That prerequisite did not remove
scene publication copies: native producer wiring, exposure/alpha/extent
semantics and full-frame pixel verification remained. The dependency push was
blocked by auto-review pending explicit owner approval; the parent gitlink is
not committed. No main-game build, capture or Quest run. Exact evidence and
small-tool storage accounting: `research/20260905_2047_native-attachment-resolves.md`.

Scoped native scene-result checkpoint (2026-09-05): scene end supplies exact
sampled colour/depth/exposure through a per-view, frame-bounded, single-use
result. Native target pins and temporary output references preserve its lifetime;
normal post no longer imports scene image getters or traverses resolve links.
All 30 CTests and 45 source guards pass. Capture-disabled diagnostics exercise
both MSAA materialization and direct source images. Normal flat/VR record
3,001/8,401 completed native inputs and zero imports, original scopes or refusals.
Both 120-frame sequences have 0/119 large changes and no cyan hits; first/last
VR depth is correctly crossed and all full eye/flat endpoints were inspected.
Initial scene MSAA/scale copies and output adapters, final UI publication, engine
producers and parent scheduling remain. Multi-root/HDR/nested-view GPU cases,
existing VR blur and full-game gates remain unqualified; no Quest. Six superseded
normal raw sets and their automatic copies/links were removed, preserving 16
PNGs/reports and all protected evidence. The new pair is the baseline; net volume
usage fell 7.38 GiB, ending with 60.97 GiB free. The historical archive remains
over budget; no new raw allowance remains. Exact source, runtime and retention:
`research/20260905_1958_native-scene-image-result.md`.

Explicit native post-image checkpoint (2026-09-05): native atlas/composite and
optical/noise consumers now use actual sampled colour/depth images and exposure.
The sequence imports the scene boundary once, passes completed images directly
between roots, applies incoming exposure once and publishes only the final result
for remaining UI/getter consumers. No intermediate resolve publication or new
cross-frame resource cache. All 30 CTests and 42 source guards pass. Normal flat/
VR record 3,001/7,801 native sequences/imports/final publications, zero original
scopes or refusals. Both 120-frame sets have 0/119 large changes and no cyan hits;
first/last VR depth is correctly crossed, all full endpoints inspected. Only one
root is GPU exercised; multi-root/HDR image flow remains unqualified on GPU.
Initial scene resolve/getter import, final UI publication, engine producers and
parent frame scheduling remain. Existing VR blur, authored events and full-game
gates remain open; no Quest. Four superseded normal raw sets removed, preserving
16 PNGs/reports and all distinct startup/preview/failure evidence; the new pair
is the baseline. Net volume usage fell 2.94 GiB, ending with 53.59 GiB free.
Exact evidence, consumed budget and retention review:
`research/20260905_1929_native-post-image-flow.md`.

Native scene-post handoff checkpoint (2026-09-05): the main scene caller now
passes its explicit colour/depth images directly to native effect scheduling,
skipping both guest temporary-container constructors, wrapper invocation and
complete destructors. Camera/focus updates and saved effect flags remain intact.
All 30 CTests and 39 source guards pass; only the affected guest partition
regenerated/rebuilt. Normal flat/VR record 3,001/7,801 direct handoffs and zero
original container/wrapper/post scopes or refusals. Both 120-frame sequences
have 0/119 large changes and no cyan hits; first/last eye depth is correctly
crossed and all full endpoint images inspected. Scene-output getters, resolve
links/exposure, engine producers, parent scheduling, UI and full-game gates
remain; distant VR blur is not fixed. No Quest. Removed superseded readiness
normal raws, kept all eight PNGs and protected startup/failure evidence; equal
replacement raw bytes leave the archive unchanged. Net volume usage increased
18.11 MiB, ending with 50.64 GiB free. Exact evidence and retention:
`research/20260905_1912_native-scene-post-handoff.md`.

Native effect-sequence checkpoint (2026-09-05): the supported complete list
wrapper now schedules post roots on the host with explicit depth, without
the guest global-depth copy, virtual dispatch or container cleanup. Full
callback/plan preflight, bounded alternating outputs and ordered focus
publication preserve the sequence contract. All 30 CTests and 36 source guards
pass. Normal flat/VR record 2,701/8,101 native sequences, zero original wrappers
or post scopes/refusals; only one root per sequence is GPU exercised. Both
120-frame captures have 0/119 large changes and no cyan; first/last VR depth
is correctly crossed and both full eyes were inspected. Multi-root/unknown
callback GPU coverage, resolve links/exposure, engine producers, UI and complete
frame/game gates remain. Its scene temporary containers are removed by the
newer handoff checkpoint above. No Quest.
Two superseded normal raw sets removed with eight PNGs/reports retained;
replacement raw bytes exactly match removal, so the raw archive did not grow.
Net volume usage increased 49.91 MiB, ending with 50.66 GiB free. Exact evidence:
`research/20260905_1842_native-effect-sequence.md`.

Native post-input readiness checkpoint (2026-09-05): the three recurring
startup/transition refusals were fresh depth images lacking sampling descriptors.
Native whole-post and direct DoF preparation now create/refresh explicit input
views under the host mutex, without a guest texture-binding warm-up frame.
Normal flat/VR runs have 3001/8101 sampled native post scopes, zero original
scopes and zero input refusals. All 29 CTests and 34 source guards pass;
120-frame normal flat/VR sequences have 0/119 large changes, no cyan and
correctly crossed first/last VR depth. Both eyes inspected. Early-startup
probes show the existing blank title background and fade, not qualified artwork
or stereo depth. Image/property/UI adapters, authored effect-event coverage,
late-scene failures and complete frame/game gates remain. No Quest.
Three superseded raw sets removed with reports/images retained; net volume
usage decreased 1.20 GiB after verification, with 50.71 GiB free. The archive
is still over budget and frozen against growth. Exact evidence and retention:
`research/20260905_1807_native-post-input-readiness.md`.

Native directional-bloom checkpoint (2026-09-05): mode 1 now imports authored
sigma/gain/count into native parameters and produces independent horizontal
and vertical masks in at most two private quarter-pair atlases. One layered
render pass per iteration and a 32-byte kernel replace guest mask caches,
blur submission and emulated resolves. Bright preparation precedes heat;
composition keeps both masks unwarped. All 29 CTests and 33 source guards
pass. Strong flat/VR previews have 0/31 large changes and no cyan, but washed
out near geometry makes preview VR depth inconclusive. Normal flat/VR have
0/119, no cyan and crossed first/last depth; both eyes inspected. Authored
mode-1 events/kernel comparisons, combined heat/bloom, other bloom-kernel
approximations, three input refusals, image/property/UI adapters and complete
frame/game gates remain. No Quest. Three superseded normal raw sets removed
to fund bounded verification, reclaiming 3.89 GiB while retaining small and
protected evidence. Full evidence, retention and net storage accounting:
`research/20260905_1726_native-directional-bloom.md`.

Native heat-shimmer checkpoint (2026-09-05): flag-16 filtering now selects
depth-aware scene/DoF coordinates inside the native composite, with four
noise samples and unwarped bloom. Existing cooked images, shared-eye host
animation and an explicit 224-byte composite layout replace the producer,
mutable guest phase array, submission and another intermediate/resolve.
All 28 CTests and 30 source guards pass. Strong synthetic flat/VR previews
show coherent animated distortion but have 31/31 large changes, not normal
stability passes. Normal flat/VR have 0/119, no cyan and correctly crossed
first/last VR depth; both eyes inspected. Authored heat events/comparisons,
VR comfort, dual-mask bloom, image/property/UI adapters and full-frame/game
gates remain. Three input refusals per run remain. Runs stopped and profile
restored; no Quest. Three superseded normal raw sets removed, retaining
reports/images, recovered 3.89 GiB; after new verification the net saving
is 87.27 MiB with 49.49 GiB free. The historical archive remains over budget
under a frozen inventory and explicit review triggers. Exact evidence:
`research/20260905_1644_native-heat-shimmer.md`.

Native colour-grading checkpoint (2026-09-05): discolor, animated grain and
gamma/saturation/gain/bias/target correction now use native parameters,
explicit layered images and an 80-byte shader layout. The supported path
removes the packed producer/submission, texture-list binding, gameplay RNG,
engine intermediate and emulated resolve. Three post stages share at most
two scratch images. Existing cooked grain assets are reused, not copied.
All 27 CTests and 28 source guards pass; 860 original grading/activation and
scanline-strength comparisons match. Corrected grain/grade flat and combined
VR previews have 0/31 large changes; normal flat/VR have 0/119 and no cyan,
with correctly crossed first/last VR depth. Both eyes inspected. Startup
native/control first/last images match exactly, including their existing
white background; title artwork is not qualified. Normal VR now has 9,598
native scopes and three input refusals instead of thousands of packed-effect
fallbacks. A longer interrupted preview reached 77 input refusals; its late
window was not captured or qualified. Intervening/dual-mask effects, image/
property/UI adapters, blur, full-frame and full-game gates remain. No Quest.
Ten superseded normal raw sets were removed, retaining reports/images and
protecting baseline/previews/failures; 11.68 GiB actually recovered. The
historical archive still exceeds the 10 GiB target and needs further review;
the former "active" totals were not total storage. Profile restored, runs
stopped. See `research/20260905_1603_native-post-grading.md` for exact binary,
coverage, deliberate animation changes and cleanup/retention accounting.

Native scanline checkpoint (2026-09-05): the supported post scope now owns its
final four-tap filter and animation on the host. Native image dimensions,
frame-index noise shared by both eyes, private scratch and explicit output
replace the guest producer/wrapper, state-308 calls, texture setters and
emulated resolve. The existing noise-off default remains. All 26 CTests and
26 source guards pass. The noise-disabled flat preview has 0/31 large changes;
the combined animated optical/scanline VR preview has 1/31 (6.33%), inspected
as changing horizontal bands, not counted as a normal stability pass. Normal
flat and 1440x1584-per-eye VR have 0/119 large changes, no cyan patches and
correctly crossed first/last VR depth. Both eyes inspected, profile restored,
all runs stopped; 42.34 GiB free with 8.60 GiB active unique raw evidence.
Authored activation/parameter comparisons and event coverage remain unqualified.
Packed/intervening filters, dual masks, image/property/UI adapters, existing
blur, late-scene failures and full-frame/full-game gates remain. No Quest run.
See `research/20260905_1527_native-scanline.md` for source, GPU coverage and
the deliberate separation of effect animation from gameplay RNG.

Native optical-adjustment checkpoint (2026-09-05): fisheye and colour inversion
now execute in one native layered pass, with explicit parameters and native
attachment records. Composite/flare render directly into private native input
scratch when needed; these filters no longer call their guest producers,
texture/depth setters, intermediate target allocation or emulated resolve.
The shared optical curve uses output aspect ratio instead of a fixed console
canvas. All 26 CTests and 24 source guards pass. Negative flat and positive
both-eye previews show coherent distortion/inversion with 0/31 large jumps.
Normal flat and 1440x1584-per-eye VR sequences have 0/119 large jumps and no
cyan patches; first/last normal VR depth is correctly crossed. Both eyes were
inspected, original profile restored, no app jobs remain, and no Quest run
occurred. Previews are synthetic: authored activation/parameter comparison and
VR comfort are not qualified. NTSC scanline/noise, intervening/packed filters,
dual-mask mode, image/property/output adapters and the full-frame/game gate
remain. Earlier late-scene failures are not superseded. See
`research/20260905_1504_native-post-adjustments.md` for exact evidence and
storage accounting (46.15 GiB free; no assets duplicated or outputs deleted).

Native lens-flare checkpoint (2026-09-05): the complete supported flare
producer and sprite submission now execute as native recipes and a single
instanced draw into the owned post output. No lens wrapper, per-sprite
constant flush, texture setter, UP vertices, target allocation or emulated
resolve executes on that path. Shared C++/HLSL quadrant folding preserves the
authored optical assets without copying them. The initial visible preview
exposed a wrong globally-linear UV assumption; corrected first/last images
in both eyes show smooth glows/rings instead of quarter-image rectangles.
All 26 CTests and 22 source guards pass; a diagnostic recorded 3615 matching
original sprite parameter checks and 5142 matching bloom checks. The supported
normal post scope now has zero old tail-effect/state-308 calls, superseding
the one-effect/three-state-call boundary in the prior checkpoint below.
Final normal flat and 1440x1584-per-eye VR 120-frame sequences have 0/119
large jumps and no cyan patches; first/last VR depth is correctly crossed.
Both eyes were inspected; flat Shu/windmill shadows remain. Original profile
restored, all agent-started app runs stopped, and no Quest run occurred.
Packed effects, other trailing adjustments, dual-mask mode, non-flare input
refusals, authored light/visibility producers, image/getter adapters and per-eye
optics remain. Full-frame, late-scene and full-game qualification are not done;
the synthetic preview does not qualify authored visibility or VR comfort.
See `research/20260905_1422_native-lens-flare.md` for the exact conversion,
failed preview, correction and bounded normal flat/VR checks.

Native post scheduling checkpoint (2026-09-05): supported DoF/bloom dispatch
now runs directly from authored native parameters into an explicit persistent
post output. It bypasses the bloom texture caches, blur loops, ms_tex input
array, shader-hash composite trigger and that scope's EDRAM allocation/resolve.
All 26 CTests and nineteen source guards pass; 3642 flat diagnostic parameter
checks match. Normal flat and 1440x1584 final-eye 120-frame sequences have
0/119 large changes and no cyan patches, with correctly crossed first/last
stereo depth. Flat Shu and windmill shadows remain. At that checkpoint one
trailing effect and three state-308 calls per tested field frame still executed
(replaced by the lens-flare checkpoint above); startup packed
effect combinations and two image/preflight refusals per normal run retain
the counted original scope. Other filter combinations, mode-1 dual masks,
image/getter/UI adapters and complete frame ownership remain. VR blur,
character-shadow visibility, late-scene and full-game qualification remain
unfinished. Original profile restored; no Quest run. See
`research/20260905_1344_native-post-scheduling.md`.

Native DoF producer checkpoint (2026-09-05): complete preparation and matching
quad-submission bodies are replaced by native parameters, explicit scene/depth
images and the host atlas. The supported path no longer executes the five-level
allocation/blur loops, DoF texture-binding loop, intermediate target or resolve,
and does not read PS c27. All 26 CTests and sixteen source guards pass; a flat
diagnostic has 6901 matching original parameter publications. Normal flat and
1440x1584 final-eye runs have 0/31 large changes in their 32-frame captures;
both first/last eye checks show correctly crossed depth. Flat Shu/windmill
shadows remain. Each normal run still records three startup/transition DoF
fallbacks, whose exact failed preflight condition remains to be traced.
Engine properties, authored camera/focus sources, image/getter adapters,
bloom execution/register inputs and the outer post scheduler remain. VR blur,
character-shadow and full-game coverage remain unqualified; field focus logs
above 1.0 are a new investigation lead, not a complete blur diagnosis. Disk
space limited the new sequences to 32 frames; they do not replace longer
qualification. Native sun remains opt-in, the original profile is restored,
and no Quest run occurred. See
`research/20260905_1256_native-dof-producer.md`.

Tracked camera ownership checkpoint (2026-09-05): a native per-view scope
selects the submitted scene camera and reuses one composed result across
its consumers. Arbitrary matrix setters no longer treat light cameras and
2D/post resets as headset cameras. This also stops unrelated view writes
from advancing anchor smoothing. All 25 CTests and thirteen source guards
pass. Normal 1440x1584 final-eye VR has 0/119 large changes and correctly
crossed first/last depth (far -1, near -9, spread 8 pixels); both eyes were
inspected. The original flat control is also 0/119, with Shu's cast silhouette.
These results supersede the earlier short-view foreground/depth findings,
not the late-scene failure or full-game gate. Distant blur and VR character
shadow qualification remain. Native sun stays opt-in; XR scale stays 0.65.
The original view scheduler, descriptor/camera sources, interpolation,
reflection derivation and post-focus producer remain conversion boundaries.
See `research/20260905_1216_scoped-native-xr-camera.md`.

Native eye geometry checkpoint (2026-09-05): scene and final layered output
now share the full native runtime extent instead of fitting the whole 3D
frame to the authored 16:9 HUD canvas. UI scaling remains separate; native
projection presentation uses the complete viewport without console alignment
rounding. All 24 CTests and thirteen source guards pass. The scale-1.0 desktop
OpenXR run verifies 1440x1584 scene/final eyes with image content across all
1584 rows in both inspected eyes, superseding earlier 1440x808/letterbox
findings for this path. The foreground passage still flags 10/119 large
changes; blur and inconclusive depth remain. Normal flat output has 0/119
large jumps and Shu's cast silhouette. UI/cinema/movie GPU coverage, readable
near/far framing, scene/output getter adapters, other frame producers and
broader desktop qualification remain. Native sun camera stays opt-in and
the default XR scale stays 0.65. See
`research/20260905_1026_native-full-eye-geometry.md`.

Native sun camera experiment (2026-09-05): current-view orthographic fitting,
scene snapshot and an explicit sun-scope culling volume are implemented, but
`bd_native_sun_camera` is **off by default**. GPU controls and exact character
submission source isolated a second, obsolete light-eye-distance cutoff after
the sphere cull. A scoped instruction adapter now skips that cutoff only for
the owned native sun pass; complete character submission is not converted.
The normal comparison-off short flat sequence restores Shu's cast silhouette,
with 0/119 large jumps, no cyan patches, 28173 matching attachment checks and
zero original snapshot/light-fit/cull-comparison calls. The diagnostic sequence
flagged two transitions around one changed foliage/shadow frame; the normal
run does not establish their cause or longer-term absence. All 23 CTests and
thirteen source guards pass. Normal 1440x1584 final-eye output has 10/119 large
changes during an inspected foreground-object passage, with 103019 matching
shadow ownership checks and no camera fallback. That passage is not yet
attributed to the camera change. That run's eyes were blurred/letterboxed with
1440x808 scene content; the native eye geometry checkpoint above supersedes
its sizing/letterbox finding, but depth and character-shadow visibility remain
unqualified in that framing. The default still executes the counted engine
snapshot/light fitter; the hooked binary's default-off short flat control has
0/119 large jumps, Shu's cast silhouette present and zero cutoff bypasses.
Final-eye and broader camera qualification remain;
no Quest result is claimed. See
`research/20260905_0956_native-sun-character-visibility.md`, which supersedes
the missing-caster conclusion in the earlier experimental-camera note, and
`research/20260905_1004_native-sun-final-eye-check.md` for the subsequent run.

Sun-shadow lifecycle checkpoint (2026-09-05): the complete begin/end bodies
now own an explicit persistent depth attachment and retained output association.
Native entry/exit and explicit-source publication replace engine allocation,
pass wrappers and resolve-source guessing. Empty caster passes publish their
owned far-depth clear; shadow output no longer publishes a post/UI tile chain.
All 22 CTests and nine source guards pass. The normal short desktop sequence
has 0/119 large jumps or cyan patches, 38674 matching ownership checks and no
lifecycle fallback. The same binary's normal 1440x1584 final-eye sequence also
has no large jumps/cyan patches, with 102251 matching ownership checks and no
fallback. VR remains blurred/letterboxed and depth-inconclusive; scene content
is still 1440x808. Later scenery/text and other shadow modes are not qualified.
Engine scene-camera snapshot and light-fitting execution remain
counted, and secondary shadows, caster scheduling and sampling/resource/getter
adapters remain. This is not a complete shadow system or fully native frame.
See `research/20260905_0756_native-shadow-pass-lifecycle.md`.

View-cache checkpoint (2026-09-05): complete camera/frustum-cache execution
and native cached-shape ownership now use host inverse/unprojection,
roll-free orientation and native transform values. Normal production does
not import engine planes or clip points. All 22 CTests and seven source
guards pass; the corrected desktop comparison records 15341 matching full
publications, zero fallback/matrix imports/cache bootstraps and a stable
120-frame sequence with no large jumps or cyan patches. Float cofactor and
trigonometric ordering corrections are documented, not hidden by a wider
tolerance. Normal comparison-off flat and full-size final-eye sequences also
have no large jumps or cyan patches, with 18054/41174 native view updates,
no fallback/imports and no missing native culling volume. Final eyes remain
blurred/letterboxed and depth-inconclusive; the scene stays 1440x808 during
the final-eye sequence, despite 1440x1584 output layers.
Engine camera sources, invalidation/settings, getter publications and broader
scene/frame ownership remain. Cache-hit/alternate-selection GPU coverage and
later scenery/text are not qualified. See
`research/20260905_0717_native-view-cache.md`.

Scene lifecycle checkpoint (2026-09-05): both scene begin/end bodies now run
on the host with explicit persistent colour/depth roles, typed native pass
entry/exit and explicit-source output publication. The supported path no
longer uses the engine's 16-slot allocation list, surface constructors,
tiling branch or resolve-source guessing. All 21 CTests and five source
guards pass; the final corrected-build desktop run has 53375 matching ownership checks,
no begin/end fallback and 0/119 large capture jumps or cyan patches. Initial
VR validation exposed one-layer depth outputs; creation now preserves both
eyes. The corrected full-size final-eye sequence also has 0/119 large jumps,
no cyan patches and 124147 matching ownership checks without fallback.
The camera/cache execution boundary is converted by the checkpoint above;
state 308, engine camera sources/descriptors/getters,
shared MSAA/scale copies and downstream post/UI tile-chain adapters remain.
This is not a completed scene producer set or fully native frame. VR remains
blurred/letterboxed and depth-inconclusive; later scenery/text are not
requalified. Both normal flat and final-eye checks use the corrected build. See
`research/20260905_0641_native-scene-pass-lifecycle.md`.

Frustum producer checkpoint (2026-09-05): complete six-plane construction
executes on the host, and the default-view host walk consumes a native
current-frame volume instead of importing engine planes. All 20 CTests and
three source-boundary guards pass. The final byte-safe build records 18341
matching original publications, 436841 matching consumer-shadow checks, zero culling
disagreements/fallbacks/missing native volumes and 0/119 large capture jumps.
Exceptional startup values are handled natively too. Normal comparison-off
flat and 1440x1584 final-eye sequences also have 0/119 large jumps and no
frustum fallbacks or missing native volumes. VR remains blurred/letterboxed
and depth-inconclusive; later scenery/text were not requalified.
Engine view/projection/cache producers,
other-view tables and getter publications remain. Scene lifecycle conversion
is tracked above. This
cluster is view-frustum construction, not the previously inferred fog helper.
See `research/20260905_0559_native-frustum-producer.md`.

Parameter producer checkpoint (2026-09-05): two complete pass-projection
builders, matrix transposition, parameter flushing and both float setters
execute on the host for supported inputs. All 19 material/texture/state CTests
and three source-boundary guards pass. The final guarded-build comparison
records 1891328 matching publications, zero refusals/fallbacks, and 0/119 large
jumps in its short desktop sequence. Normal comparison-off flat and full-size
final-eye sequences also have 0/119 large jumps, no cyan patches and no parameter
fallbacks. VR remains blurred/letterboxed and depth-inconclusive; later scenery
and text were not requalified. Engine inputs/parameter descriptors, inline
writers, draw-time shader-register import and full scene-begin ownership remain.
See `research/20260905_0513_host-parameter-producers.md`.

Sampler producer checkpoint (2026-09-05): complete scene defaults, seven direct
sampler setters and supported changed engine setter calls execute on the host.
All 18 material/texture/state CTests and three source-boundary guards pass.
The live original-publication comparison has 146571 matches and zero fallbacks;
normal short flat and full-size final-eye sequences also have 0/119 large jumps
and no cyan patches, with no sampler fallbacks. VR remains blurred/letterboxed
and inconclusive for depth; later scenery/text were not requalified. Inline
material writers and per-draw fetch import remain: this is producer execution
conversion, not complete live native sampler or frame ownership. See
`research/20260905_0436_host-sampler-producers.md`.

Nested pass checkpoint (2026-09-05): supported pass push/pop execution now
uses a host-owned attachment/extent stack and shared host attachment binders.
The engine's saved handles remain checked getter/lifetime adapters; native
pop does not recover its targets from them. All 17 material/texture/state/pass
CTests and three source-boundary guards pass. Normal short/late/final-eye runs
exercise native colour/depth/null scopes with no compatibility calls or shadow
mismatches (peak nesting 1). Short desktop and full-size 1440x1584 final eyes
have 0/119 large jumps, but later rock-wall popping remains (110/119 large
changes), and VR still has blurred/letterboxed content and inconclusive depth.
These are getter-shadow checks, not an original-producer comparison. Engine
traversal, scene-begin producers, allocation/resolve adapters and full frame
scheduling remain. See
`research/20260905_0355_native-pass-scopes.md`.

Scene-image replay checkpoint (2026-09-05): explicit per-draw current/next
roles now replace retained image bindings for converted scene callbacks.
Ordinary writes clear role ownership; null remains a no-op. Replay resolves
today's inputs and preflights the whole node outside the video/store locks.
All 16 material/texture/state CTests and three source-boundary guards pass.
The sampled run records 3414 matching scene-input checks and 11613 composed
scene-role draws; the general replay comparator still fails other inputs.
The source guard also distinguishes equal images selected by different table
paths. Normal execution records 34 matching source checks and 13133 dispatched
scene-role draws, with no refusal/compatibility calls. Later scenery still fails:
113/119 large changes and inspected rock-wall popping. Final-eye multiview at
explicit XR scale 1.0 produces 1440x1584 eyes with 0/119 large changes, but content
is still 1440x808 letterboxed/blurred and depth is inconclusive. That VR view
exercises no scene-role draws. Native scene associations, intra-node pass
sequences, other retained inputs and full visual qualification remain. See
`research/20260905_0318_native-scene-input-recipes.md`.

Scene-image producer checkpoint (2026-09-05): current/next scene-table selection
and the complete scene-image binding callback now execute on the host, with
explicit native image handles, live dynamic adapters and counted null no-ops.
Both bindings are preflighted outside the video lock before publication.
All 15 material/texture/state CTests pass. Desktop producer comparison records
39485 matching selections and 14 matching binding publications, with no
compatibility/refusal calls. All 28 bound inputs use native handles; dynamic
and null publication cases were not exercised. Its early field/title-transition
capture does not qualify the normal comparison-off path, later scenes or VR.
Scene-table production, persistent scene associations, remaining replay recipes,
the wrapper's blend/constants and full visual qualification remain. See
`research/20260905_0301_native-scene-textures.md`.

Reflection binding checkpoint (2026-09-05): supported direct phase-0 draws now
decode explicit selection and enable recipes, resolve current pass/table inputs
before submission, and discard the retained slot-5 image. All sub-draw bindings
are preflighted before dispatch. Null-selection inheritance remains an explicit
compatibility refusal, not an invented unbind; ordinary/animated overrides,
deferred/nonzero-phase recipes and persistent native scene associations also
remain. See `research/20260905_0144_native-reflection-selection.md` for source,
the initial diagnostic failure, corrected integration and verification scope.
This is not a completed reflection pass or fully native frame.
The corrected sampled transition has 490655 matching source checks, 179
unsupported scene-target callback draws and no slot-5 differences in the
bounded replay log. Supported GPU coverage here is disabled, pass-default
reflection selection; table-selected/enabled/dynamic cases remain unqualified.
The subsequent normal late run deadlocked between capture's texture lookup and
an IO upload, before producing captures. Source validation now snapshots at
draw time and resolves outside the video lock before template publication;
14 CTests and two source-boundary guards pass. The corrected normal run advances
through loading, with 1214021 matching source checks (including 6701 enabled
pass-default draws), but later rock-wall popping and damaged text remain:
108/119 large frame changes. Table/dynamic bindings remain unqualified. Normal
final-eye multiview has 0/119 large jumps but blurred/letterboxed, below-target
936x1030 eyes and inconclusive depth. See
`research/20260905_0235_reflection-validation-lock-order.md`.

Lighting checkpoint (2026-09-05): the complete lighting setup producer and its
reset/dimension helper execution now run on the host. Address-free records hold
ambient/camera/colour and shadow sampling inputs; supported direct phase-0
replays use the explicit shadow sampling record instead of retained constants.
The corrected short run has 13538 matching full publications and 200650 matching
direct-node input checks, with 0/119 large frame jumps. All 13 standalone
upload/state/verification/lighting tests pass. Engine scene/light descriptors,
texture associations, material staging/flush, other draw recipes and full-game
verification remain. The normal late run has 43580 host publications with zero
compatibility/reset calls and 700323 matching direct-node checks, but still
loses scenery and damages text (107/119 large frame changes). Normal multiview
has 0/119 large jumps but blurred/letterboxed eyes, inconclusive depth and the
same below-target 936x1030 eyes. See
`research/20260905_0121_native-lighting-pass.md`.

Verification follow-up (2026-09-05): replay diagnostics now retain bounded
examples in later scenes, report declared shader-input differences separately,
compare buffer fields without padding noise and flag incomplete compared-draw
counts. All 12 standalone upload/state/verification tests pass. Recurring reports
identify camera and animated-UV input mismatches; the sampled late baseline
still loses background surfaces and has damaged text. This is a diagnostic
checkpoint, not a new native producer or a fix for those pixels. See
`research/20260905_0053_recurring-draw-verification.md` for exact scope and runs.

Latest skin checkpoint (2026-09-05): explicit per-draw joint bindings now come
from model commands or deferred-entry indices. The host gathers each draw's
current palette before submission; matrix-value identity guessing and the
single final-node bone table are removed. Independent tests cover equal poses
that diverge, different per-draw bindings, capacity and transactional failures.
The normal late run records 787878 source checks with zero mismatches and
481158 replayed palettes. Inspected character stretching is gone, superseding
that specific failure in the earlier packet checkpoint below. Background
surfaces and text still fail: 110/119 frame pairs exceed the 6% jump threshold.
Normal final-eye multiview has 0/119 large jumps but inconclusive stereo depth.
See `research/20260905_0025_native-skin-bindings.md` for both runs and the
replay-off control. Skeleton/animation evaluation, pose sources, persistent
skin scene assets, discovery/list adapters and the shader-register ABI remain
explicit conversion boundaries; this is not a fully native skinned frame.

Packet checkpoint (2026-09-05): host draw packets now retain authoritative shader,
declaration and raster/blend/alpha intent throughout dispatch. Engine bind/setter
history no longer overwrites replay packets, and shared vertex decoding uses the
packet declaration. The new SDK-independent ownership regression test passes
alongside the other ten upload/state tests, and the desktop renderer linked
without rebuilding guest objects.

With replay enabled, the latest short flat and final-eye multiview sequences each
have 0/119 jumps over 6% and no cyan patches. Inspected eyes no longer have broad
horizontal banding. This supersedes the short-field flicker findings in earlier
checkpoints below; it does not qualify other scenes. Stereo depth remains
INCONCLUSIVE, blur/letterboxing remains, and actual eyes are 936x1030 instead of
the 1440x1584 target. At that checkpoint, a longer run using the prior late-scene
capture settings failed with deformed characters, disappearing scenery and
damaged text. See `research/20260905_0010_native-draw-late-scene.md`; zero allocation
failures and zero cyan patches do not qualify those pixels.
See `research/20260904_2348_native-draw-intent.md` for the replay-off control,
consumer overwrite trace, normal-path captures and remaining producer boundaries.
Earlier raster/blend/alpha draw-application counters included replay flushes;
their zero-mismatch setter checks did not establish packet ownership. The replay
comparator also did not dispatch its expected packet, so a zero pipeline-state
mismatch count could not detect this consumer bug.

The subsystem checkpoints below retain their historical verification outcomes.
Their remaining conversion boundaries still apply unless explicitly superseded.

`gpu/scene/native_mesh*` starts the native geometry asset boundary: loaded
model indices become triangle lists, GPU-ready vertex streams are persisted,
and native assets upload into shared host geometry arenas. Existing generated
LOD lists feed that same importer. The format contains no guest addresses.

This does **not** yet remove the draw-template interpreter dependency. The
importer currently retains packed vertex layouts understood by the existing
shaders, and its discovery is attached to replayed node draws. Complete native
material/layout definitions, asset-level loading, dynamic geometry, cache
streaming/eviction and replacement of the guest frame and draw producers are
still work to do. `bd_native_meshes` is on by default after the desktop checks
recorded in `research/20260904_1713_native-mesh-assets-and-capture-ownership.md`.
The counters cover indexed replays, not every draw in the game.

`gpu/scene/native_material*` now decodes named diffuse, specular/shininess and
reflection-colour properties from model commands into host-owned records. The
supported direct-tree phase-0 draws compose these with the object's colour,
without reading a sibling draw or the shared material staging globals.
`bd_native_materials` is on by default. Unsupported/ambiguous cases retain the
tracked compatibility path; this is not a complete native material system.
Materials are now shared immutable assets with stable content IDs, a checked
little-endian `.bdmat` format, independent cooking/loading and bounded residency.
The lighting-model slot includes a reserved Cel value; no native cel shader is
claimed. See [the format and cooker](NATIVE_MATERIAL_FORMAT.md). Complete texture
associations, mesh/material scene-asset loading, list-entry/phase-1 recipes, complete
lighting/shader definitions and shader-ABI replacement remain required. See
`research/20260904_1748_native-material-properties.md` for exact coverage and
correctness-only comparisons, and
`research/20260904_1806_persistent-native-material-assets.md` for independent
loading, cold/warm desktop captures and the persistent-asset tests.

`gpu/scene/native_shadow*` now composes a named receiver-shadow policy from
current node visibility and decoded model controls, instead of retaining that
decision in an old draw template. `bd_native_shadow_inputs` is on by default
for supported direct-tree phase-0 draws. The pure policy and stamp checks have
standalone tests; sampled and normal desktop checks found no input-composition
mismatches. This is still an import boundary: the pass enable, visibility stamps
and frame counters remain guest-produced, and the result still enters the old
shader ABI. List/phase-1 recipes and persistent shadow policy in native material
assets remain unconverted. It does not fix the recurring multiview defect.
See `research/20260904_2041_native-shadow-receiver-inputs.md` for exact coverage,
flat captures and the failed/inconclusive VR checks.

Deferred depth ordering and bounded allocation/batch planning now execute on
the host (`gpu/scene/deferred_work.h` and the temporary `deferred_list.cpp`
bridge). Replayed batches refresh world/palette and relocate their material
self-reference instead of retaining the original pooled pointer. The native
core has standalone capacity, ordering and relocation tests. This still
publishes big-endian entry images; remaining entry fields, material/pass records
and engine storage require conversion. The consumer replacement below now owns
the consuming loop. See `research/20260904_2055_host-deferred-work.md` for the
earlier allocation/sort checkpoint.
Its short flat check passes, but multiview still shows 10/119 jumps and the
later scene 79/119 with missing scenery/damaged text. Neither allocation/sort
conversion nor pointer relocation resolves those visual failures.

`gpu/scene/deferred_depth.h` now produces initial and replay depth on the host
from explicit bounds/far-extent or fixed policies. Replayed keys use current
world/view inputs, not old numeric depth. Whole-batch preflight includes depth
validation, and every entry must agree with its recipe's matrix source.
`bd_native_deferred_depth` defaults on. The input comparison recorded 20483
checks with zero mismatches; the final normal-path flat sequence has 0/119
jumps over 6% and no cyan patches. Multiview still has 10/119 jumps at the
64-frame cadence, with an inconclusive stereo-depth check. See
`research/20260904_2122_live-native-deferred-depth.md`.
The object/view transforms remain engine-produced; bounds/policy discovery is
not yet native scene-asset loading. Engine storage and other entry fields remain
tracked boundaries. The prior later-scene failure has
not been requalified by this short-run checkpoint.

`gpu/scene/deferred_consumer.cpp` now owns deferred-list iteration, visual-switch
scheduling, CPU bone gathering, material constant publication, ordinary/fur/
stencil surface expansion, direct draw issuance and list cleanup. Its valid-input
path replaces the original `sub_8227F360` loop. `bd_native_deferred_consumer`
defaults on; the explicit compatibility switch/import fallback is counted.
Standalone surface-policy and shader-ABI packing tests pass. The final flat
sequence has 0/119 jumps and no cyan patches; final multiview still has 10/119 jumps
at a 64-frame cadence and an inconclusive stereo-depth result. See
`research/20260904_2154_host-deferred-consumer.md` for verification and limits.

This is not a fully native frame: visual/material/shader callbacks and
state/resource adapters remain, with separate bridge counters. Some resource
adapters already route to host hooks, so these are boundary-call counts, not a
precise guest-instruction census. Engine entry storage, resource/declaration
associations, shader-register packing and replay's retained-state assumptions
still need replacement. Fur/stencil policies have standalone coverage but the
captured field does not exercise those GPU paths. The known later-scene failure
and full-game/both-eye acceptance gates remain open.

Object/pass transform publication is now host-produced too
(`gpu/scene/native_transform*`). The normal `bdBuildViewMatrix` path replaces
the guest producer, its default callback, transpose/multiply helpers and
constant setter. Camera interpolation/XR view composition feeds it directly
from native memory. `bd_native_transforms` defaults on; comparisons and
compatibility calls are counted independently. The final comparison recorded
826215 checks with no cache/constant/mask mismatches or compatibility calls,
including 203 nonfinite loading updates previously refused. Native assets
still use strict finite-value validation. See
`research/20260904_2216_native-render-transforms.md`.
The final normal flat sequence has 0/119 jumps and no cyan patches. Normal
desktop multiview produced 2387514 native transform updates with zero
comparison/compatibility calls, but still has 10/119 jumps at the 64-frame
cadence, blurred/banded eyes and an inconclusive stereo-depth result.
Engine object/camera/projection sources, inherited matrix cache and the
shader-register publication ABI remain temporary boundaries. This does not
replace native scene/pass scheduling or fix/qualify the previously documented
multiview and later-scene failures.

Raster/depth/stencil intent now lives in named host state (`native_raster*`).
The normal path replaces 15 `bdSetRenderState` setters and copies live native
fields at draw time, removing the per-draw engine raster-cache read/conversion.
`bd_native_raster` defaults on; diagnostic comparison defaults off. The live
comparison recorded 1491692 setter checks and 3070903 ordinary draw-state
checks, with zero publication mismatches/cache drift and one bootstrap import.
The normal flat sequence has 0/119 jumps and no cyan patches. Normal desktop
multiview still has 10/119 jumps at the 64-frame cadence, blurred/banded eyes
and an inconclusive stereo-depth result; it does not qualify VR correctness.
See `research/20260904_2238_native-raster-intent.md` for tests and captures.
Getter/cache/register shadows remain explicit engine adapters. Sampler,
other-state and material/pass producers, CCW stencil behavior, replay recipes and native
scene/pass assets remain unconverted. Field captures do not exercise stencil
operation/mask setters. This is not full frame or both-eye qualification.

Blend intent now also lives in named host state (`native_blend*`), with eight
host setters and no normal per-draw blend-register read/conversion.
`bd_native_blend` defaults on; comparison defaults off. The comparison recorded
4002268 setter checks and 3073105 ordinary draw checks without publication
mismatches, untracked blend writes or compatibility calls, using one bootstrap
import. Its short flat sequence has 0/119 jumps and no cyan patches.
The normal flat path also has 0/119 jumps and no cyan patches, with 4007188
native blend updates and no blend comparison/compatibility calls.
Normal desktop multiview records 8979675 host blend updates without blend
comparison/compatibility calls, but still reproduces 10/119 jumps at the 64-frame
cadence, banded/blurred eyes and inconclusive stereo depth. This is not a VR pass.
The source trace did not substantiate the earlier claim of inline device blend
writers outside the SDK setters; unrelated matching object offsets are not D3D
device writes. Verification still explicitly checks for untracked writers.
See `research/20260904_2302_native-blend-intent.md`. This is not a complete native
material/pass producer: getter/cache shadows, blend constants,
other-state execution and retained replay recipes remain. Separate-alpha and
operation setters have standalone coverage but no field GPU exercise so far.

Alpha cutout/coverage intent is now host-owned too (`native_alpha*`), with four
host setters and live ordinary-draw composition instead of retained pipeline
intent. `bd_native_alpha` defaults on; verification defaults off. The shared
C++/HLSL predicate supports all eight compare modes through specialization, and
the reference uses the SDK's exact 1/255 scale, correcting the former 1/256 hook.
CPU tests and regenerated SPIR-V verify the comparison contract, including
explicit ordered-NaN behavior. Publication comparison recorded 7196829 setter
checks and 7108657 draw-intent checks with zero mismatches/drift/compatibility
calls. The final normal flat path records 2274942 native updates without alpha
comparison/compatibility calls, 0/119 frame jumps and no cyan patches.
Normal desktop multiview records 13662279 native alpha updates without
comparison/compatibility calls, but the final-eye sequence still has 5/119 jumps
in one flicker cluster, blurred/banded eyes and inconclusive stereo depth. This
window does not establish recurrence or improvement over earlier two-cluster
captures. Actual eyes are 936x1030, not the requested 1440x1584 target.
See `research/20260904_2327_native-alpha-policy.md`. Engine getter/cache shadows,
native material/pass producers, replay recipes and the shader-register ABI remain.
The field exercises only GE and no alpha-to-coverage requests; other comparison
GPU paths, multisample coverage output and custom coverage offsets are not
qualified. This does not establish full frame or both-eye correctness.

Static textures now cross a persistent native boundary too: `.bdtex` files
preserve BC/RGBA data, mips, cube faces and volume slices with address-free
content IDs. The SDK-independent mip cooker persists missing chains; subsequent
loads use a versioned recipe cache without regenerating them. `bd_native_textures`
is on by default. See [the native texture contract](NATIVE_TEXTURE_FORMAT.md).
CPU assets are shared and budgeted. A device-owned native GPU store now shares
images, views and descriptors by content ID, with native handles and fence-gated
retirement independent of guest wrappers. The remaining resource bridge only
borrows those bindings. Explicit immutable material slots now hold native image
handles directly, including cube/volume companions. Stable sampler recipes use
native descriptors without per-replay fetch decoding. Inherited/dynamic inputs,
asset-level scene loading and guest draw/pass replacement remain required.
Cold/warm desktop and independent-loader evidence is recorded in
`research/20260904_1833_native-textures-and-persistent-mips.md`.
Shared GPU lifetime tests, runtime reuse/retirement and flat/multiview captures
are recorded in `research/20260904_1854_shared-native-texture-gpu-ownership.md`.
The native binding checkpoint, compound-recipe lifetime fixes and 120-frame
flat capture are recorded in
`research/20260904_1946_native-material-texture-bindings.md`. Its capture has no
jumps above 6% or cyan patches, but the longer run later exhausted a 32 MiB
constant-buffer slot. That checkpoint was not a clean long-session qualification;
the wrapping hazard is addressed by the upload separation below.

Resource staging now uses bounded, fence-reclaimed **host upload pages**,
independent of the shader-register buffer. Native textures and the native UI
use the host API directly; compatibility bulk adapters share it. Shader storage
no longer wraps on exhaustion, and transient vertex streams cannot be cached
as immutable cross-frame geometry. See [the upload contract](HOST_UPLOAD_ARENA.md)
and `research/20260904_1959_host-upload-pages.md`. A longer loading run no longer
reported overflow, but its later scene still had severe dark/missing-geometry
frames. This remains a correctness failure, not full transition qualification.
The longer baseline was rerun after the final transient-stream lifetime fixes:
77 of 119 frame pairs exceeded the 6% jump threshold and inspected frames still
showed broken geometry/text. Upload separation did not solve that scene.

The earlier diorama control exposed a 64-frame lighting flash in the existing
template path, present with native meshes or native materials disabled too.
The upload-page checkpoint's multiview check reproduced that cadence: 10 jumps in
119 frame pairs, with no upload or constant-storage errors. The presented eyes
in that distant view still do not establish a stereo-depth verdict.
The native packet-ownership fix above removes those jumps and broad banding in
its short capture, but still does not establish stereo depth or full-game
correctness. The host transition is not complete.
